#### Preparation Instructions

**Moussaka**
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
3. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat and fry the eggplant slices until golden brown. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.
4. In a large skillet, heat some olive oil and sauté the chopped onion until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
5. Add the ground beef or lamb to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat.
6. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), cinnamon, oregano, allspice, salt, and pepper. Let it simmer for 20 minutes.
7. For the béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes.
8. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the nutmeg, Parmesan cheese, and egg yolks.
9. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, followed by the meat sauce, and then the remaining eggplant slices. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top.
10. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.

**Greek Salad**
1. In a large bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, green bell pepper, and Kalamata olives.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
3. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine.
4. Top with crumbled feta cheese just before serving.

**Baklava**
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a bowl, mix the chopped walnuts and ground cinnamon.
3. Brush a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Place a sheet of phyllo dough in the dish and brush with more butter. Repeat with 7 more sheets.
4. Sprinkle a thin layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo.
5. Continue layering 8 sheets of phyllo and the walnut mixture until all the walnuts are used, finishing with a top layer of 8 sheets of phyllo.
6. Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond shapes.
7. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. While the baklava is baking, make the syrup by combining water, sugar, honey, vanilla extract, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
9. Pour the hot syrup over the baked baklava immediately after it comes out of the oven. Allow it to cool completely before serving.

#### Serving Suggestions
- Serve the Moussaka hot, straight from the oven, with a side of Greek Salad.
- For dessert, serve the Baklava at room temperature, perhaps with a cup of Greek coffee.
