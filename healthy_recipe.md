#### Preparation Instructions

**Vegetarian Moussaka**
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
3. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat and fry the eggplant slices until golden brown. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.
4. **Prepare the Lentils:** Rinse the lentils under cold water. In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but not mushy. Drain any excess water and set aside.
5. **Cook the Mushrooms:** In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the finely chopped mushrooms and cook for about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their moisture and are browned.
6. **Sauté the Aromatics:** Add the chopped onion to the skillet with the mushrooms and cook for another 5 minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
7. **Combine Ingredients:** Stir in the cooked lentils, crushed tomatoes, and tomato paste. Mix well to combine. Add the cinnamon, oregano, thyme, allspice, salt, and pepper. Pour in the red wine and vegetable broth, if using. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the mixture to thicken slightly.
8. For the béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes.
9. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the nutmeg, Parmesan cheese, and egg yolks.
10. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, followed by the lentil-mushroom mixture, and then the remaining eggplant slices. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top.
11. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.

**Greek Salad**
1. In a large bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, green bell pepper, and Kalamata olives.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
3. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine.
4. Top with crumbled feta cheese just before serving.

**Baklava**
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a bowl, mix the chopped walnuts and ground cinnamon.
3. Brush a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Place a sheet of phyllo dough in the dish and brush with more butter. Repeat with 7 more sheets.
4. Sprinkle a thin layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo.
5. Continue layering 8 sheets of phyllo and the walnut mixture until all the walnuts are used, finishing with a top layer of 8 sheets of phyllo.
6. Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond shapes.
7. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. While the baklava is baking, make the syrup by combining water, sugar, honey, vanilla extract, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
9. Pour the hot syrup over the baked baklava immediately after it comes out of the oven. Allow it to cool completely before serving.

#### Serving Suggestions
- Serve the Vegetarian Moussaka hot, straight from the oven, with a side of Greek Salad.
- For dessert, serve the Baklava at room temperature, perhaps with a cup of Greek coffee.

#### Explanation of Replaced Ingredients
- **Ground Beef or Lamb:** Replaced with a combination of lentils and mushrooms to mimic the texture and umami flavor of the meat. This ensures the dish remains hearty and flavorful.
- **Red Wine (Optional):** Maintained for depth of flavor, but if omitted, the dish remains delicious and vegetarian.

Enjoy your delicious and hearty vegetarian Greek dinner!
