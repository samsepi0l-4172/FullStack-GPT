       "'Victory Mansions is described as a run-down apartment building in the novel. The hallway smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats, and the building is not well-maintained. The lift is often not working, and at the time described in the text, the electric current was cut off during daylight hours as part of an economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The building has seven flights of stairs, and posters with an enormous face and the slogan \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\" are displayed throughout the building.'"
