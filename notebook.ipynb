       "AIMessage(content='Victory Mansions is a run-down and dilapidated apartment building where the protagonist, Winston, resides in George Orwell\\'s novel \"1984.\" It has a crumbling facade, broken elevators, shabby hallways, and small, cramped apartments with peeling wallpaper and faulty plumbing. The building lacks basic amenities, and the residents often face shortages of food and other necessities. The hallway smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats, and a large poster of an enormous face with the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\" is prominently displayed. The building has a faulty lift, and Winston\\'s flat is located seven flights up. From the roof of Victory Mansions, one can see four other buildings, including the Ministry of Truth, suggesting it is located in London, Airstrip One. The overall atmosphere of Victory Mansions is grim and oppressive, reflecting the dystopian society depicted in the novel.')"
