How many atoms in the universe?\\n\\nHow many protons are there in the universe?\\n\\nIn an atom, the number of protons and electrons is equal.\\n\\nSo if an atom has 6 protons it has 6 electrons.\\n\\nThe number of protons in a nucleus is called the atomic number.\\n\\nThe atomic number is the same for all atoms of an element, but can be different for atoms of different elements..\\n\\nHow many electrons and neutrons are in the universe?\\n\\nThe mass of the universe is 6 x 10^53. The number of protons and the number of neutrons are the same for all atoms of a particular element. The number of electrons depends on the charge of the atoms.\\n\\nHow many protons and neutrons are in the solar system?\\n\\nThe mass of the sun is 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (2.0 X 1030) kilograms.
