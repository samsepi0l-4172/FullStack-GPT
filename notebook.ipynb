       "AIMessage(content=\"For a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala, you can replace the chicken with a plant-based alternative such as tofu or paneer. Here's how you can prepare these alternatives:\\n\\n1. **Tofu**: \\n   - Use firm or extra-firm tofu for this recipe.\\n   - Drain the tofu and press it to remove excess water. You can do this by wrapping the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and placing a heavy object on top for about 15-30 minutes.\\n   - Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and follow the same marination process as you would with chicken. Tofu absorbs flavors well, so marinating it for a good amount of time will enhance its taste.\\n\\n2. **Paneer**:\\n   - Paneer is a type of Indian cottage cheese that holds its shape well when cooked.\\n   - You can either make paneer at home or buy it from the store. If making at home, boil milk, curdle it with lemon juice or vinegar, strain the curds, and press them to form a block of paneer.\\n   - Cut the paneer into cubes and lightly pan-fry or grill them before adding to the masala sauce. This step helps the paneer hold its shape and adds a nice texture to the dish.\\n\\nBy using tofu or paneer as a substitute for chicken, you can enjoy a flavorful and vegetarian-friendly version of Chicken Tikka Masala.\")"
