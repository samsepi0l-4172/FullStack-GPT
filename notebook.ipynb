       "AIMessage(content='Victory Mansions is a run-down apartment building where Winston Smith lives in the novel \"1984\" by George Orwell. The building is described as having narrow staircases that are never fully lit, always smelling of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. The hallway outside Winston\\'s apartment is dimly lit by electricity that only works intermittently. The building is infested with rats, and the apartment itself is cramped and shabby, with peeling wallpaper and a faulty telescreen that is constantly monitoring Winston\\'s every move. Overall, Victory Mansions is a bleak and oppressive place that reflects the oppressive and totalitarian society depicted in the novel. It also serves as a vantage point from which the other buildings in Oceania can be observed.')"
