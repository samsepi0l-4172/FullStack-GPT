      "#### Moussaka\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).\n",
      "2. Sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.\n",
      "3. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat and fry the eggplant slices until golden brown. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.\n",

      "8. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the nutmeg, Parmesan cheese, and egg yolks.\n",
      "9. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, followed by the meat sauce, and then the remaining eggplant slices. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top.\n",
      "10. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine.\n",
      "4. Top with crumbled feta cheese just before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Baklava\n",

      "2. In a bowl, mix the chopped walnuts and ground cinnamon.\n",
      "3. Brush a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Place a sheet of phyllo dough in the dish and brush with more butter. Repeat with 7 more sheets.\n",
      "4. Sprinkle a thin layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo.\n",
      "5. Continue layering 8 sheets of phyllo and the walnut mixture until all the walnuts are used, finishing with a top layer of 8 sheets of phyllo.\n",

      "7. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown.\n",
